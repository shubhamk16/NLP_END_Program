Standard RNNs suffer from the [vanishing gradient problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vanishing_gradient_problem). LSTMs overcome this by having an extra recurrent state called a _cell_, $c$ - which can be thought of as the \"memory\" of the LSTM - and the use use multiple _gates_ which control the flow of information into and out of the memory. For more information, go [here](https://colah.github.io/posts/2015-08-Understanding-LSTMs/). We can simply think of the LSTM as a function of $x_t$, $h_t$ and $c_t$, instead of just $x_t$ and $h_t$.\n",

        "\n",
        "The initial cell state, $c_0$, like the initial hidden state is initialized to a tensor of all zeros. The sentiment prediction is still, however, only made using the final hidden state, not the final cell state, i.e. $\\hat{y}=f(h_T)$.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Bidirectional RNN\n",
        "\n",
        "The concept behind a bidirectional RNN is simple. As well as having an RNN processing the words in the sentence from the first to the last (a forward RNN), we have a second RNN processing the words in the sentence from the **last to the first** (a backward RNN). At time step $t$, the forward RNN is processing word $x_t$, and the backward RNN is processing word $x_{T-t+1}$. \n",

        "### Multi-layer RNN\n",
        "\n",
        "Multi-layer RNNs (also called *deep RNNs*) are another simple concept. The idea is that we add additional RNNs on top of the initial standard RNN, where each RNN added is another *layer*. The hidden state output by the first (bottom) RNN at time-step $t$ will be the input to the RNN above it at time step $t$. The prediction is then made from the final hidden state of the final (highest) layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "The image below shows a multi-layer unidirectional RNN, where the layer number is given as a superscript. Also note that each layer needs their own initial hidden state, $h_0^L$.\n",

        "### Regularization\n",
        "\n",
        "Although we've added improvements to our model, each one adds additional parameters. Without going into overfitting into too much detail, the more parameters you have in in your model, the higher the probability that your model will overfit (memorize the training data, causing  a low training error but high validation/testing error, i.e. poor generalization to new, unseen examples). To combat this, we use regularization. More specifically, we use a method of regularization called *dropout*. Dropout works by randomly *dropping out* (setting to 0) neurons in a layer during a forward pass. The probability that each neuron is dropped out is set by a hyperparameter and each neuron with dropout applied is considered indepenently. One theory about why dropout works is that a model with parameters dropped out can be seen as a \"weaker\" (less parameters) model. The predictions from all these \"weaker\" models (one for each forward pass) get averaged together withinin the parameters of the model. Thus, your one model can be thought of as an ensemble of weaker models, none of which are over-parameterized and thus should not overfit.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Implementation Details\n",
        "\n",
        "Another addition to this model is that we are not going to learn the embedding for the `<pad>` token. This is because we want to explitictly tell our model that padding tokens are irrelevant to determining the sentiment of a sentence. This means the embedding for the pad token will remain at what it is initialized to (we initialize it to all zeros later). We do this by passing the index of our pad token as the `padding_idx` argument to the `nn.Embedding` layer.\n",
        "\n",
        "To use an LSTM instead of the standard RNN, we use `nn.LSTM` instead of `nn.RNN`. Also, note that the LSTM returns the `output` and a tuple of the final `hidden` state and the final `cell` state, whereas the standard RNN only returned the `output` and final `hidden` state. \n",
        "\n",
        "As the final hidden state of our LSTM has both a forward and a backward component, which will be concatenated together, the size of the input to the `nn.Linear` layer is twice that of the hidden dimension size.\n",
        "\n",
        "Implementing bidirectionality and adding additional layers are done by passing values for the `num_layers` and `bidirectional` arguments for the RNN/LSTM. \n",
        "\n",
        "Dropout is implemented by initializing an `nn.Dropout` layer (the argument is the probability of dropping out each neuron) and using it within the `forward` method after each layer we want to apply dropout to. **Note**: never use dropout on the input or output layers (`text` or `fc` in this case), you only ever want to use dropout on intermediate layers. The LSTM has a `dropout` argument which adds dropout on the connections between hidden states in one layer to hidden states in the next layer. \n",
        "\n",
        "As we are passing the lengths of our sentences to be able to use packed padded sequences, we have to add a second argument, `text_lengths`, to `forward`. \n",
        "\n",
        "Before we pass our embeddings to the RNN, we need to pack them, which we do with `nn.utils.rnn.packed_padded_sequence`. This will cause our RNN to only process the non-padded elements of our sequence. The RNN will then return `packed_output` (a packed sequence) as well as the `hidden` and `cell` states (both of which are tensors). Without packed padded sequences, `hidden` and `cell` are tensors from the last element in the sequence, which will most probably be a pad token, however when using packed padded sequences they are both from the last non-padded element in the sequence. \n",
        "\n",
        "We then unpack the output sequence, with `nn.utils.rnn.pad_packed_sequence`, to transform it from a packed sequence to a tensor. The elements of `output` from padding tokens will be zero tensors (tensors where every element is zero). Usually, we only have to unpack output if we are going to use it later on in the model. Although we aren't in this case, we still unpack the sequence just to show how it is done.\n",
        "\n",
        "The final hidden state, `hidden`, has a shape of _**[num layers * num directions, batch size, hid dim]**_. These are ordered: **[forward_layer_0, backward_layer_0, forward_layer_1, backward_layer 1, ..., forward_layer_n, backward_layer n]**. As we want the final (top) layer forward and backward hidden states, we get the top two hidden layers from the first dimension, `hidden[-2,:,:]` and `hidden[-1,:,:]`, and concatenate them together before passing them to the linear layer (after applying dropout).
