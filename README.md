# NLP_END_Program

GPT3 or the END of NLP as we know it!
In this course I have learned about Deep NLP beyond RNNs/LSTMs from scratch and learn why everything until GPT3 is absolete now.

1.Background and Basics of Modern NLP
2. Embeddings & Dimensionality
3. Advanced Python for NLP & Processing
4. PyTorch for NLP and Model Types
5. Backpropagation for NLP
6. Dependency Parsing for NLP
7. RNNs are dead and their renewed relevance
8. Attention and Memory in Deep NLP
9. Deep NLP using Convolutions
10. Transformers with Linear Attention
11. Infinity Capstone Project
